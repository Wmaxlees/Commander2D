1. Respect the players time
    -- Everything they do should contribute in some way to their
       goals.

2. Reward Clever Group Combinations
    -- Group composition should have a big impact
    -- There shouldn't be 1 meta group
    -- Different Affixes on levels means particular units are not useful.

3. Reactive and Dynamic Combat
    -- Every action should have an immediate visceral reaction.
    -- Interactions should be clear (i.e. increased fire damage from
            someone using a weakness effect on an enemy should clearly
            indicate there was increased damage from the weakness.)
    -- No autoattack turns.
    -- No reskinned enemies. Each enemy type should have unique abilities
       that must be interacted with.
    -- No rotations.

4. Infinitely Replayable



OTHER

Unlocking units should be exciting and difficult.
    -- Set dungeon style unlock system (you have to use the unit and leverage
       its unique abilities to unlock it permanently.)
